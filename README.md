# IoT Security Solution with Real-Time Threat Detection and Mitigation

## 1. Executive Summary
The **IoT Security Solution** addresses growing threats to connected IoT devices, including **DDoS attacks, malware infections, and unauthorized access**. The system monitors network traffic in real time using **AI-driven anomaly detection and PKI-based authentication**. It features a **self-healing mechanism** to isolate, clean, and reintegrate infected devices. A user-friendly **dashboard** allows users to monitor, isolate, mitigate, and manage security threats efficiently.

## 2. Problem Statement
- **IoT Security Risks:** IoT devices are vulnerable to cyberattacks such as DDoS, MITM attacks, and malware.
- **Unauthorized Access & Data Breaches:** IoT networks lack proper security controls, risking data exposure.
- **DDoS Attacks & Botnets:** Compromised devices can form botnets, leading to large-scale DDoS attacks.

## 3. Solution Overview
This project provides a **comprehensive AI-driven security solution** for IoT networks using:
- **AI-Driven Threat Detection:** Monitors network traffic in real-time for anomalies.
- **PKI Authentication:** Ensures only authorized devices join the network.
- **Self-Healing Network:** Isolates, cleans, and reintegrates infected devices.
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Centralized interface for security monitoring and threat mitigation.

## 4. Architecture
### 4.1 System Components
- **ESP32/Raspberry Pi Gateway:** Monitors network traffic and detects threats.
- **ARP Poisoning:** Reroutes suspicious traffic for isolation.
- **Dashboard:** Graphical interface for monitoring and device management.
- **Certificate Authority (CA) Integration:** Manages PKI authentication.

### 4.2 Workflow
#### Traffic Monitoring & MITM Prevention:
1. Gateway detects abnormal traffic patterns (e.g., high traffic spikes from DDoS attacks).
2. Suspicious devices are isolated using **ARP poisoning**.

#### Self-Healing for Infected Devices:
1. Infected devices are **isolated** and undergo a **firmware update/reset**.
2. Once secure, they are **reintegrated into the network**.

#### PKI-Based Authentication:
1. Devices authenticate using **public/private key pairs**.
2. Flask server challenges devices, which sign the challenge using their **private key**.

#### Dashboard Functions:
- **Real-time monitoring** of device status.
- **Isolate and clean** infected devices.
- **View detailed logs** of security events.

## 5. System Features
- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** AI-driven anomaly detection.
- **Self-Healing Network:** Automatic isolation and mitigation.
- **PKI Authentication:** Secure device access.
- **Easy-to-Use Dashboard:** Web-based security management.
- **Tamper-Resistant Hardware:** PUF integration for enhanced security.

## 6. Technology Stack
### **Hardware:**
- **ESP32 / Raspberry Pi** (user-dependent)

### **Software:**
- **Backend:** Python
- **API & PKI Management:** Flask
- **AI Models:** Anomaly detection algorithms
