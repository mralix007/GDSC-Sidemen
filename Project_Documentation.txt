Project Report: IoT Security Solution with Real-Time Threat Detection and Mitigation

1. Executive Summary

The IoT Security Solution is designed to address the growing threats to connected IoT devices, including DDoS attacks, malware infections, and unauthorized access. The system monitors network traffic in real time, leveraging AI-driven anomaly detection and PKI-based authentication. It provides a self-healing mechanism for infected devices, ensuring that they are isolated, cleaned, and reintegrated into the network. Additionally, the system features a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and managing devices, enabling security teams or users to isolate, mitigate, and clean infected devices.


2. Problem Statement

.IoT Security Risks: IoT devices are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks such as DDoS, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and malware. Traditional security measures are often ineffective due to limited computational resources on IoT devices.

.Unauthorized Access and Data Breaches: IoT networks are vulnerable to unauthorized access, putting sensitive data and devices at risk.

.DDoS Attacks and Botnets: Compromised IoT devices can form botnets, leading to massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm networks and cause widespread damage.


3. Solution Overview

This project provides a comprehensive AI-driven security solution for IoT networks, using a combination of real-time traffic monitoring, PKI-based authentication, and self-healing mechanisms. The solution includes:

.AI-Driven Threat Detection: Continuous monitoring of network traffic to detect suspicious behavior, anomalies, and potential threats.

.PKI Authentication: Ensures that only authorized devices can join the network using public/private key infrastructure.

.Self-Healing Network: Isolates infected devices, cleans them through firmware updates and resets, and reintegrates them once they are secure.

.Real-Time Dashboard: A centralized interface that allows users to isolate, mitigate, and clean devices, providing full control and visibility over the IoT network.


4. Architecture

4.1 System Components

.ESP32/Raspberry Pi Gateway: Acts as an intermediary between the IoT devices and the Internet, monitoring network traffic for anomalies.

.ARP Poisoning: Used to reroute traffic from suspicious devices to the monitoring system, isolating them from the rest of the network.

.Dashboard: Provides a graphical interface for users to view real-time device status, isolate infected devices, initiate cleaning processes, and reintegrate devices into the network.

.Certificate Authority (CA) Integration: Manages public/private keys for secure authentication between devices and the network.

4.2 Workflow

Traffic Monitoring & MITM Prevention:

.The gateway continuously monitors traffic for abnormal behavior (e.g., high traffic spikes indicative of a DDoS attack).

.Suspicious devices are isolated using ARP poisoning to prevent them from accessing the Internet.

Self-Healing for Infected Devices:

.Once isolated, the infected device undergoes a firmware update and reset process through the dashboard to remove any malware or vulnerabilities.

.After cleaning, the device is reintegrated into the network, ensuring it's safe to use.

PKI-Based Authentication:

.Devices authenticate using PKI, with each device having its own private/public key pair.

.The Flask server challenges the device with a random challenge, which the device signs using its private key for authentication.

Dashboard Functions:

.Real-time monitoring of device status.

.Allows users to isolate infected devices, initiate cleaning procedures, and reintegrate devices once they’re secure.

.Provides detailed logs of device activity, anomalies, and security events.


5. System Features

.Real-Time Threat Detection: Uses AI and machine learning to continuously monitor IoT device traffic for suspicious behavior.

.Self-Healing Network: Automatically isolates infected devices and initiates a cleaning process (e.g., firmware update, factory reset).

.PKI Authentication: Secures device access through public/private key pairs, preventing unauthorized devices from joining the network.

.Easy-to-Use Dashboard: A user-friendly interface for monitoring, isolating, mitigating, and cleaning devices within the network.

.Tamper-Resistant Hardware: Integration of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to ensure that devices cannot be easily impersonated or tampered with.
